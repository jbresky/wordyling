This is a project based on an idea to improve language learning, serving as a complement.

It is not a game app. The main purpose is to keep organized the words you are acquiring, see their translations, categorize them, and even create sentences.

Before I started developing this app, I was saving all my words in a Google Doc, but then I realized it wasn't scalable ðŸ˜‘ because I wanted to sort them by length and alphabetically as well. So, this idea just hit me.
